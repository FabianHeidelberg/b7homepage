					<ul>		
						</li>
						<li>All teams must be rookie teams with a starting value of 1.100.000 gold pieces (and not less, so no inducements).</li>

						<li>We will use the offical rulebook from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloodbowl.com">Games Workshop</a>  and all additional rules according to the NAF as you can read <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.thenaf.net/blood-bowl/rules/">HERE</a>. That will include the Death Zone Season 2 as also stated by the NAF  <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.thenaf.net/2017/05/naf-and-death-zone-2/">HERE</a>  </li>

						<li>Wizards, Star Players, Freebooters or other inducements are not allowed.
Except for stunty teams they are allowed to hire starplayers as a permanent member for all 5 games. As well as the Masterchef for the Halflings of course</li>

						<li>The coaches will be paired using the Swiss format, i.e. based on their ranking after each round. You'll never play the same coach twice.</li>

						<li>All casualties that have been inflicted on your team are wiped away at the end of the game.</li>

						<li>Before the tournament, you choose according to the table (Race - Skillcount) skills and apply them to your roaster. We need you to send in two roasters one before day one and another one for day two. Players can get only skills from their available skill categories.</li>

						<li>We will not use the 4 minute time rule. Instead you'll have about 2 hours to complete the match. We'll inform you if you need to speed up. I don't expect this to happen, but we reserve the right to cut a game short if you really go beyond limits.</li>

						<li>We don't force you to use the turn marker illegal procedure call. If both coaches want it in effect, so it is. Otherwise you just remind your opponent if he forgets his turn marker.</li>

						<li>You need to bring with you at least 2 copies of your Team Roster (each version).</li>

						<li>The whole event area is a strictly non-smoking area.</li>

						<li>The decision of the Referee is final and no discussion will be entered into.</li>

						<li>The primary purpose of our tournament is to get together so that we can play our favourite game, meet other players who share our interests and have a lot of fun.</li>

						<li>You can use all Teams that are mentioned in the NAF Tournament Teams which are in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thenaf.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NAF_Tournament_Teams.pdf">this</a> PDF.</li>
