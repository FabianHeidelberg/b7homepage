				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>All teams must be rookie teams with a starting value of 1.100.000 gold pieces (and not less, so no inducements). Keep in mind that a FF of 0 is now allowed.</li>

						<li>We will use the <a href="http://www.thenaf.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CRP1.pdf">CRP -Rulebook</a></p></li>

						<li>Wizards, Star Players, Freebooters or other inducements are not allowed.
Halfling teams are allowed to buy their master chef for 100.000 gold pieces. He is a permanent part of the team and useable in all 5 matches.</li>

						<li>he coaches will be paired using the Swiss format, i.e. based on their ranking after each round. You'll never play the same coach twice.</li>

						<li>All casualties that have been inflicted on your team are wiped away at the end of the game.</li>

						<li>Before each game (after you know the opponents race) you may pick a normal skill (no doubles) and give it to one of your players. Only one skill per player maximum and only skills from their available skill categories.</li>

						<li>We will not use the 4 minute time rule. Instead you'll have about 2 hours to complete the match. We'll inform you if you need to speed up. I don't expect this to happen, but we reserve the right to cut a game short if you really go beyond limits.</li>

						<li>We don't force you to use the turn marker illegal procedure call. If both coaches want it in effect, so it is. Otherwise you just remind your opponent if he forgets his turn marker.</li>

						<li>You need to bring with you at least 2 copies of your Team Roster.</li>

						<liWe will try to provide real stadiums instead of cardboard pitches for each tournament table.></li>

						<li>The whole event area is a strictly non-smoking area.</li>

						<li>The decision of the Referee is final and no discussion will be entered into.</li>

						<li>The primary purpose of our tournament is to get together so that we can play our favourite game, meet other players who share our interests and have a lot of fun.</li>
